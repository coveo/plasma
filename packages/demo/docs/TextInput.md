## Guidelines

### Restrictions & Size

-   Users should be informed of any input restrictions, such as restrictions on character types or string length.
-   The text input area width should suggest the expected size of the user input. Try to forsee the text input length so as to avoid cutting it off. The text input area should be large enough to display the whole text input in most cases.
-   Avoid setting a character limit, or make sure to set it high enough to avoid constraining most user entries. If this is not possible, let users know how many characters are left.
-   Ensure that users with small screens can still enter all required information.

### Behaviour

-   Display an inline validation message when the user is done interacting with the input.
