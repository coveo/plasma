## Guidelines

### General

-   If space allows, and there are no more than 7 options in total, consider using [checkboxes](#/components/Checkbox) instead.
-   Keep option labels as short as possible in order to limit width to a minimum.
-   When an option is selected, it should be removed from the options list.

### Options Sorting

-   Always put the most common items at the top of the list. If no option is more common than the others, use alphanumeric or chronological order.

### Label

-   In most cases, you should include a label to identify the component.
