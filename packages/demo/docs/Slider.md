## Guidelines

### General

-   For binary settings, use a [slide toggle](#/styles/form-controls/slide-toggle), [toggle](#/components/FlatSelect), or [checkbox](#/components/Checkbox) instead.

### Labels

-   In most cases, Sliders should have a label.

-   Use the shortest mark labels possible, ideally one word (e.g., Lower, Middle, Higher).

### Behavior

-   Adjust the size and behavior of the rail so that users have access to the precision level they need, no more, no less.

-   Always set the lowest value on the left side and the highest on the right.

-   You may include labeled marks to help users select discrete values (e.g., Lower, Middle, Higher). Jumping to those marks is possible by clicking on them or on their labels.
