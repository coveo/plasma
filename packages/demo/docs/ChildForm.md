## Guidelines

-   Try to display only one Child Form at a time in a given option set.
-   If the user navigates between options within the set, make sure to keep track of their previously selected Child Form values, so that they can retrieve those values when reactivating the corresponding parent options. The unselected Child Form contents can be cleared once the form is saved.
