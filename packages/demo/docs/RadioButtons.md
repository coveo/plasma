## Guidelines

(See also: **Guidelines for All Form Controls** - _coming soon!_)

### General

-   The set of options should always have a title.
-   Use wording that indicates that the user can **only select one option**. Some users may not know the difference between radio buttons and checkboxes.
-   Put the most common options at the top of the list, unless your options have a strong logical ordering (such as prices or sizes).
-   Keep the number of options per set under 7.

### Label

-   Try to limit label text to one short line.
-   Add a description or help hint only if necessary.

### Behavior

-   Preselect the recommended option. If there is none, preselect the option most likely to be selected by users.
-   Never use radio buttons if the set of options is not exhaustive. The user **must** select an option.
