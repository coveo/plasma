## Guidelines

### Do

-   Keep the **text short** and direct (ideally 3 lines maximum). For more detailed explanations a link to external documentation should be used.
-   Have Tooltips **appear in empty areas** of the screen, or on top of less relevant information.
-   Only show **one Tooltip at a time**.

### Do Not

-   Do not use Tooltips to display **information that most users need**. Use regular text instead.
-   Avoid adding Tooltips that display the same text as what **can already be read in the interface** (e.g., a Tooltip with "Print" as its content is not necessary on a button with the label “Print”).
-   Avoid using Tooltips for information regarding **errors or warnings**. Displaying this information is too important to depend on hovering.
