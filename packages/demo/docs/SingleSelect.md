## Guidelines

### General

-   If space allows, and there are no more than 7 options to choose from, consider using [radio buttons](#/components/Radio) instead.
-   Keep option labels as short as possible in order to limit width to a minimum.

### Options Sorting

-   Always put the most common items at the top of the list. If no option is more common than the others, use alphanumeric or chronological order.

### Label

-   In most cases, you should include a label to identify the component.
