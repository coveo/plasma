                            using a prompt. The user should be able to copy and paste the information.

            <p className="body-m-book-subdued">
                Inline Validation is direct feedback displayed as the user progresses through the form to confirm that
                their answers are valid. Inline Validation helps people complete forms quickly and with less effort,
                fewer errors, and more satisfaction. The opposite approche is to validate all the inputs at the end of
                the process, when the user submits the form.

            <p className="body-m-book-subdued">
                It can give many types of feedback: suggestions for valid answers, confirmation that a correct answer
                was given, and live updates designed to help people stay within necessary limits.
            </p>
            <p className="body-m-book-subdued">
                Inline validation is useful for the answers that are not obvious, answers with specific formatting
                requirements or answers with potentially high error rates (e.g., Name would not be appropriate for
                inline validation).

            <p className="body-m-book-subdued">
                Ideally, links and <span className="bolder">button hit zones</span> should not be smaller than{' '}
                <span className="bolder">44px by 44px</span> so that they are easy to activate on touch screens with the
                average human finger size and, with a mouse or trackpad, do not require a too precise aim.
            </p>
            <p className="body-m-book-subdued">
                If the hit zone has to be <span className="bolder">smaller for technical reasons</span>, it is important
                to make sure that there is a{' '}
                <span className="bolder">44px non-clickable space around the hit zone plus a 10px clearance</span>{' '}
                (minimum non-clickable space between 2 hit zones), which makes a{' '}
                <span className="bolder">54px by 54px non-clickable space required for any hit zone.</span>
