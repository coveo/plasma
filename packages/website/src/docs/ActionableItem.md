# Best Practices

Use an actionable item when your page offers actions that are of secondary importance and that don't need to be displayed directly on the page.

An actionable item must be displayed upon the click of a button.

An actionable item must be contextual and suited to the user's needs based on their selection.

Use a divider line to divide actions into logical groups.

## Labeling

Keep labels short, preferably **under three words**. Use trigger words to clearly indicate the action performed by the button. A trigger word is typically a verb that influences users into clicking due to its specificity. For example, use "View profile" rather than "Open profile", and "Create playlist" rather than "Save".

The first word of the label should be a verb. If adding a noun is required for context, avoid including an article. For example, write "Add filter" rather than "Add a filter".
