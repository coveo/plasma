# Logo use

Since Plasma is open-source, we mustn't add any copyright logos due to the nature of public availability and the potential for misuse in which Coveo may be held responsible. Any logos created by Coveo, or that are copyright free can be added to Plasma.

**For copyrighted logos, we must use the `svgChild` attribute and host the logo in a private repository.**
