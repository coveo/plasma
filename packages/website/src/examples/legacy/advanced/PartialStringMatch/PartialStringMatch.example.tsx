            I’d love to drop anchor in your lagoon. And that was done without a single drop of rum… A pirate is a man
            that is weak to achieve but too strong to steal from even the greatest achiever. Without the messy
            paperwork.

            I’d love to drop anchor in your lagoon. Where there is a sea there are pirates. You will always remember
            this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a
            pirate, after all. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. Right from the
            Voyage og Noah, surviving was by sailing. Avast ye! and sail against the tides.
