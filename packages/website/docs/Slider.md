# General

-   For binary settings, use a [toggle](#/form/FlatSelect), or [checkbox](#/form/Checkbox) instead.

# Labels

-   In most cases, Sliders should have a label.
-   Use the shortest mark labels possible, ideally one word (e.g., Lower, Middle, Higher).

# Behavior

-   Adjust the size and behavior of the rail so that users have access to the precision level they need, no more, no less.
-   Always set the lowest value on the left side and the highest on the right.
-   You may include labeled marks to help users select discrete values (e.g., Lower, Middle, Higher). Jumping to those marks is possible by clicking on them or on their labels.
