# Do

-   The text must be direct and to the point, ideally a max of 3 lines. Link to external documentation when detailed explanations are required.
-   Tooltips must **appear in empty areas** of the screen, or on top of less relevant information.
-   Only show **one Tooltip at a time**.

# Do Not

-   Use tooltips to display **required information**. Pertinent information must be presented in the regular text.
-   Add tooltips that display the same text as what **can already be read in the interface** (e.g., a tooltip with "Print" is not necessary on a button with the label “Print”).
-   Use tooltips for information regarding **errors or warnings**. Displaying this information is too important to depend on hovering.
