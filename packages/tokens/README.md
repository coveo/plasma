# @vapor/tokens

Design tokens of the Vapor Design System extracted from Figma.

#### What is a design token?

Simply put, a design token is a stored design decision. It can be understood as a variable that holds the result of a choice (in this case made in Figma). Decisions can be made about multiple different subjects, for example colors, typography, spacing, etc. Therefore, it is important to consider that design tokens come in as many types as there are design subjects.

#### Objective of this package

Distribute design tokens to all Coveo products that rely on the Vapor Design System through code.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @vapor/tokens
```

For TypeScript users: the package provides its own type declarations.

## Usage

Tokens are provided through multiple outputs. Choose the format that best suits your needs.

### TypeScript

Coming soon.

### Sass

Coming soon.

## Internal usage

- `tokens:fetch`: fetches tokens information from our tokens library in Figma
- `tokens:build`: (coming soon) translates the fetched tokens into all the available output formats
