name: Test React 19 Compatibility

# This workflow validates that the @coveord/plasma-react package works with React 19
# while keeping React 18 as the production version. It:
# 1. Installs dependencies with React 18 (production version)
# 2. Temporarily upgrades to React 19 for testing
# 3. Builds and tests the package with React 19
#
# No changes are committed - this is purely for validation.
# This ensures consumers can upgrade to React 19 while still using these deprecated packages.
